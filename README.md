## Project decription
The goal of this project is to understand if the 25 normal features (results) that are obtained from basic blood, urine, etc. lab results can be enough to make an accurate enough Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnosis. I plan to use the Chronic KIdney Disease dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease/discussion). The dataset contains 400 rows (patient results) to train the neural network. 
If this is successful, invasive techniques won't be as necessary to make diagnoses.
